IMPORTANT WARNING: Alignment column 1 contains only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data


IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences BLPAA15180-19 and BLPDF4928-19 are exactly identical

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 1 sequence that is exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.


IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 1 column that contains only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data.
Normally these columns should be excluded from the analysis.

An alignment file with undetermined columns and sequence duplicates removed has already
been printed to file /home/joppew/qiime2-phylogenetic-placement/results/pplacer/output_directory/reference_alignment.phy.reduced
